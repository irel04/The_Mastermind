# The Mastermind 
It is simple mind game where you will guess the color combination that was generated automatically by the program

## ***** The actual project feature *****
The raw source code used data structures such as list and dictionary. 

## ***** What I added *****
1. **Bubble Sort** – I added this sorting algorithm because I feel that guessing the code with just merely an hint of correct and incorrect position is very hard.
I chose to add bubble sort so that the color generator will pick random colors and at the same time will make the color alphabetically arranged.

2. **Binary Tree** – I decided to implement this because I expected that it will be more faster to compare and check the color combinations Instead of simple iteration,
binary tree will help searching colors to the number of list even if decided to increase the code length of the color combinations

3. ** Simple GUI ** – to enhanced the appearance instead of viewing the output on the console of the IDE. I decided to implement CustomTkinter on the program

Disclaimer: The idea of the game was from "Tech with Kim" youtube channel and was innovated to comply for the subject Data Structure and Algorithm
